# Employee Retirement Analysis

## Overview of the project
The purpose of the analysis is to sort, filter and present a report of all the employees that are set to retire in the next few years. The report will help the department heads and the HR department start planning for employee changes in the company and lay the foundation for promoting existing staff, start a mentoring program and start the knowledge transfer process between the outgoing staff and in the staff that will be replacing them.
